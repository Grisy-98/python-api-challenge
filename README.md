# python-api-challenge

### Description

This challenge was split into 2 parts and tested my skills with Python requests, APIs, and JSON transversals. 

#### Part 1
The first part was creating a Python script to visualize the weather over 500 cities of varying distaces from the equator to be able to fulfill 2 requirements. 
The first requirement was to create scatter plots to show the following relationships:
- Latitude vs. Temperature
- Latitude vs. Humidity
- Latitude vs. Cloudiness
- Latitude vs. Wind Speed

The second requirement was to compute linear regression for each relationship. Before calculating the linear regression, the data was seperated into North Hemisphere and South Hemisphere. 
Once the data was seperated, then, I created a function to create the following linear regression plots:
- Northern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude
- Southern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude
- Northern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude
- Southern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude
- Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude
- Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude
- Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude
- Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude
After each pair of plots were created, then I was tasked with describing any typr of relationship that I noticed as well as other findings that are uncovered.

#### Part 2
For this part of the challenge, I was to use my weather data skills to plan future vacations. I used Jupyter notebooks, the geoViews Python library, and the Geoapify API.
