# python-api-challenge

### Description

This challenge was split into 2 parts and tested my skills with Python requests, APIs, and JSON transversals. 

#### Part 1
The first part was creating a Python script to visualize the weather over 500 cities of varying distaces from the equator to be able to fulfill 2 requirements. 
The first requirement was to create scatter plots to show the following relationships:
- Latitude vs. Temperature
- Latitude vs. Humidity
- Latitude vs. Cloudiness
- Latitude vs. Wind Speed

The second requirement was to compute linear regression for each relationship. Before calculating the linear regression, the data was seperated
